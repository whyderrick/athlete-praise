      <h1>About the Admirer</h1>
      <p>Derrick is a writer and technologist who loves to think about public opinion and the people who influence it. He grew up in highly competitive sporting environments, and watching the 90s-era Bulls.</p>
      <p> A few of his favorite other favorite activities and considerations are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Video games and comics as a means of analyzing speculative fiction</li>
        <li>Poetry &amp; Performance</li>
        <li>The position of hip-hop in an ever-changing America</li>
        <li>Perspective and the relativity of experience</li>
      <p>Plenty of praise content and fan sites have moved to platforms like Tumblr now, so it wasn't easy to find points of comparison for this work. I chose to use Dennis Rodman&rsquo;s personal site as a comp point, because, while there are sites that hype up athletes, but very few that lionize the misfits. (As a bonus/punishment for reading this far, here is a <a href="http://www.virtualfans.com/#">mid-90s Michael Jordan fansite</a>.)</p>
      <p> Here&rsquo;s a link to Dennis Rodman&rsquo;s site: <a href="http://dennisrodman.com">dennisrodman.com</a>. Clearly the biggest difference is CSS and styling rather than naked HTML. I think it&rsquo; arranged in an odd way with such a large hero image and such scant copy that&rsquo;s buried on the page. It seems as likely to be the site of a pornstar as a hall-of-fame basketball player. The body element contains an astonishing number of classes. While I don't particularly like the page, it seems similar in semantic layout to what I've built in that it uses article, nav, and section elements to break up the page. There are also about 15 script tags that are being invoked at the bottom of this page.

        <h1>Who&rsquo;s Marshawn?</h1>
        <p>Marshawn Lynch is an NFL running back who played with the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks. He is a native of Oakland California and is extremely reticent in interview situations.</p>
        <p>In addition to being something of a nightmare for NFL journalists, he's a terror for his opponents as well. He&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;Beast Mode&rdquo; for his tendency to run through would-be tacklers as a boar might run through a hunter.</p>
